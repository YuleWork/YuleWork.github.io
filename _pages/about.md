# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me 

Here is Yu Wang, or English name Yule. I am now a PhD student in Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO), University of Chinese Academic of Science. I majored in atmospheic science when undergraduate, and now specilize in Martian atmosphere, Martian land-atmosphere interactions and numerical simulation. I'm obsessed with Martian atmosphere, and I wish I can devote my life in Mars science.

I have published six papers now, at the top journals in both English and Chinese, with total google scholar citationstotal <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VZSkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. At the begining of my research time, I worked for climate change on Earth, GNSS-RO assimilation and troposphric delay modelling. All in all, I worked for the atmosphric related works. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - ywang@shao.ac.cn

[A real-time ZTD model in China using ERA5 and GNSS based on empirical orthogonal function method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-024-01770-z)

**Yu Wang**, Shuanggen Jin, Cheng Liu, Guanjun Zhang, Yunlong Zhang

- Introduces a novel real-time gridded Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) model combining the high spatial resolution of ERA5 data with the accuracy of GNSS-derived ZTD data. 
- Demonstrates strong performance, with mean RMS values of 1.74 cm (internal validation) and 1.89 cm (external validation).
- Valuable for areas with limited or no GNSS station coverage, enabling real-time ZTD estimates even in regions without GNSS infrastructure.
