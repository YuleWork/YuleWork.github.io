# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me 

Hi, I‚Äôm Yu Wang, but you can also call me Yule. I am currently a PhD student at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO), part of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in atmospheric science, and now I specialize in the Martian atmosphere, Martian land-atmosphere interactions, and numerical simulations. I am deeply fascinated by the Martian atmosphere and hope to dedicate my career to Mars science.

So far, I have published six papers in top-tier journals in both English and Chinese, with a total Google Scholar citation <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7VZSkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. In the early stages of my research career, I focused on Earth‚Äôs climate change, GNSS-RO assimilation, and tropospheric delay modeling. In short, my work has always revolved around atmospheric science. If you‚Äôre interested in any aspect of my research or would like to collaborate, I‚Äôm always open to discussions. Feel free to reach out to me at ywang@shao.ac.cn.

[A real-time ZTD model in China using ERA5 and GNSS based on empirical orthogonal function method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-024-01770-z)

**Yu Wang**, Shuanggen Jin, Cheng Liu, Guanjun Zhang, Yunlong Zhang

- Introduces a novel real-time gridded Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) model combining the high spatial resolution of ERA5 data with the accuracy of GNSS-derived ZTD data. 
- Demonstrates strong performance, with mean RMS values of 1.74 cm (internal validation) and 1.89 cm (external validation).
- Valuable for areas with limited or no GNSS station coverage, enabling real-time ZTD estimates even in regions without GNSS infrastructure.
